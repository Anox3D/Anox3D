Hi, I’m @Anox3D, I'm interested in almost everything language and many other things. Currently, I'm learning C, C++ and I also try to do things in other languages. If you wanna contact me, you can do it by Discord by sending me a friend request to this tag: Anox3D#9720 or join my server: https://discord.gg/D3Xk7r6Hda.

I can also accept collaboration requests, but I'm not very experimented, I'm just good at HTML and Node.js (espcially Discord bots).

Well... bye, check my repositories if you want (help is really appreciated for things I failed).
